;; A WebRequestHandlerHead component may be placed 'in front of' a

;; added via explicit dependency wiring. The advantage of this approach,
;; in comparison to traditional Ring middleware chaining, is that this
;; opens middleware chains for extension. The 'open for extension'
;; principle (also exhibited by Clojure's multimethods and records) is
;; an important feature of a modular application and considered worth
;; the extra effort required in understanding it.
