# {{name}}

A blog site, generated by [modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular).

## Requirements

This site uses a Less compiler in JavaScript that requires Nashorn, so it's only possible to use if you've got JDK 8 or later.

## Usage

To run the blog-site, install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and type

```
lein run
```

## Development

For rapid development, use the REPL from the command line or via your
favorite code editor.

```
lein repl
user> (dev)
dev> (go)
```

After making code changes, reset your application's state (causing all
your modifications to be reloaded too).

```
dev> (reset)
```

Rinse and repeat.

## Understanding how routes are matched

Unless you change it, the blog index is at `/myblog/index.html`.

You can test what it matches to from the REPL like this:

```
dev> (pprint (match-route "/myblog/index.html"))
{:handler ...
 :id :clean-blog-example.pages/index}
```

Here we see the `id` of the Ring handler. It is defined in [{{name}}/pages](src/{{sanitized}}/pages.clj).

Near the bottom of this namespace is a record named `Pages`. It satisfies bidi's `RouteProvider` protocol and returns a route structure. The leaves of this route structure and wrapped in bidi's `handler` wrapper, allowing the handlers to be associated with keywords.

You can also find out where these handlers are accessible from the REPL.

```
dev> (path-for :clean-blog-example.pages/index)
"/myblog/index.html"
```

There is a special keywords such as `:web-resources`,
`:bootstrap-resources` and `:jquery-resources` that are relate to
collections of static resources. The first corresponds to resources
under `resources/public`, the others extract resources from
[webjars](http://www.webjars.org/) that the project depends on.

```
dev> (path-for :web-resources)
"/static"
dev> (path-for :bootstrap-resources)
"/bootstrap"
dev> (path-for :jquery-resources)
"/jquery"
```

## Generating a static site

You can generate this site to a set of static files with

```
lein gen
```

You can then deploy these files to your website. Note, it's [possible to use github to serve static files](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) too.
