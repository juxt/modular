# {{name}}

A blog site, generated by [modular](https://github.com/juxt/modular).

## Usage

To run the blog-site, install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and type

```
lein run
```

## Development

For rapid development, use the REPL from the command line or via your
favorite code editor.

```
lein repl
user> (dev)
dev> (go)
```

After making code changes, reset your application's state (causing all
your modifications to be reloaded too).

```
dev> (reset)
```

Rinse and repeat.

## Generating a static site

You can generate this site to a set of static files with

```
lein gen
```

You can then deploy these files to your website. Note, it's [possible to use github to serve static files](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) too.

## Credits

The blog-site style has been taken from Start Bootstrap: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/
